### THE PROBLEM SECTION

**Section Headline:**
```
Why Agile Can't Keep Up with AI-Powered Development
```

**Body Copy:**

Agile was designed for a world where humans wrote every line of code, manually coordinated every handoff, and planned in 2-week sprints.

**That world is gone.**

**AI writes code faster than your sprint planning**  
Your team uses Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT to build in hours what used to take weeks. But you're still planning in sprints, estimating story points, and holding standups designed for a pre-AI era.

**Automation eliminates the coordination Agile was built to solve**  
Agile ceremonies exist to keep teams aligned. But AI-powered tools like Buildly Labs handle coordination automatically—surfacing dependencies, flagging blockers, and keeping everyone synced in real time.

**Your process is now your bottleneck**  
While your tools accelerate delivery, your Agile process slows it down. Sprint commitments that ignore AI velocity. Story points that don't account for automation. Retrospectives that never question whether the framework itself is obsolete.

**This isn't about doing Agile better. It's about recognizing that AI fundamentally changed the game.**

Agile was built for predictability and manual coordination. AI demands adaptability and intelligent automation.

**RAD Process + Radical Therapy is what comes next.**

---

### WHAT IS RADICAL THERAPY + RAD PROCESS SECTION

**Section Headline:**
```
Radical Therapy + RAD Process: Built for AI-Powered Teams
```

**Body Copy:**

Radical Therapy provides the principles. RAD Process provides the methodology. Together, they form the operating system for software teams building in the AI era.

**Radical Therapy: Three Core Principles**

**1. Flow Over Frameworks**  
Optimize for uninterrupted, high-quality work—not compliance with process. Your team's flow state matters more than your sprint board.

**2. Human-in-the-Loop**  
AI can accelerate, but humans decide. Use AI to amplify judgment, not replace it. Automate the mundane, elevate the strategic.

**3. Radical Transparency**  
Real-time visibility into what's being built, why it matters, and where you're stuck. No vanity metrics. No status theater. Just truth.

**RAD Process: The AI-Native Methodology**

RAD Process (Rapid Adaptive Development) is the methodology that implements Radical Therapy principles in AI-powered teams. Learn more at [buildly.io/rad-process](https://www.buildly.io/rad-process).

**Key elements:**
- **AI-assisted planning** that adapts to real-time changes
- **Automated coordination** that eliminates manual status updates
- **Outcome-focused delivery** that measures impact, not velocity
- **Continuous adaptation** instead of fixed sprint commitments

RAD Process isn't a replacement for Agile—it's what comes after Agile when AI fundamentally changes how software gets built.

---

### FROM PHILOSOPHY TO PRACTICE SECTION

**Section Headline:**
```
From Principles to Practice: Buildly Labs + RAD Process
```

**Body Copy:**

Radical Therapy provides the principles. RAD Process provides the methodology. But without AI-powered tooling, you're still coordinating manually.

**That's where Buildly Labs comes in.**

Buildly Labs is the AI-native product management platform built specifically to implement RAD Process and Radical Therapy principles. It's not a project tracker with AI features bolted on. It's a product delivery system designed from the ground up for AI-powered teams.

- **Implements RAD Process automatically**  
  No more manual sprint planning or story point estimation. Buildly Labs uses AI to plan adaptively based on your team's actual velocity and changing priorities.

- **Automates coordination that Agile ceremonies used to handle**  
  AI surfaces dependencies, flags blockers, and keeps everyone aligned in real time—without standups, status updates, or coordination overhead.

- **Enables radical transparency by default**  
  Everyone—from engineers to execs—sees the same truth. AI generates insights, not interpretations. No translation layer. Just clarity.

- **Amplifies human judgment, doesn't replace it**  
  Buildly Labs handles the coordination busywork so your team can focus on strategic decisions and building great products.

**Radical Therapy is the philosophy. RAD Process is the methodology. Buildly Labs is the AI-powered implementation.**

### WHO THIS IS FOR SECTION

**Section Headline:**
```
Who Radical Therapy Is For
```

**Body Copy:**

Radical Therapy is for teams and leaders who are done pretending.

**Founders**  
You're using AI to build faster than ever, but your Agile process is slowing you down. RAD Process + Buildly Labs gives you a system that scales with AI velocity—not against it.

**Product Leaders**  
You're caught between using AI tools and following Agile playbooks that don't account for them. RAD Process aligns strategy and AI-powered delivery without the coordination overhead.

**Engineering Teams**  
You're using Copilot and Claude to ship 10x faster, but still filling out sprint boards and story points. RAD Process + Buildly Labs lets you build at AI speed without the Agile bureaucracy.

**Distributed / Remote Orgs**  
You can't rely on standups when your team spans time zones and AI is shipping code 24/7. Buildly Labs enables radical transparency that works asynchronously and adapts to AI-powered workflows.

**If you've ever felt like your process is slowing you down instead of speeding you up, this is for you.**

### DELIVERABLE 2: One Practical Workflow – RAD Process Planning

**Purpose:** Give teams something they can implement to transition from Agile to AI-powered development

**Title:** RAD Process Planning: Replace Sprints with AI-Adaptive Delivery

**Structure:**

**What Is RAD Process Planning?**

RAD Process (Rapid Adaptive Development) planning replaces fixed sprint commitments with AI-assisted, continuously adaptive delivery. Instead of estimating story points and committing to 2-week sprints, you let AI help you plan based on real-time velocity, changing priorities, and actual outcomes.

**The Workflow (Step-by-Step):**

**Step 1: Define Outcomes, Not Features**  
What change do you want to create? What does success look like? AI can help you break down outcomes into shippable increments, but humans define what success means.

**Step 2: Let AI Map Dependencies and Risks**  
Instead of manual dependency mapping, use Buildly Labs to automatically surface blockers, dependencies, and risks. AI analyzes your codebase, team velocity, and external dependencies in real time.

**Step 3: Adaptive Prioritization**  
Priorities change. RAD Process embraces this. Instead of locking in sprint commitments, use AI to continuously reprioritize based on:
- Business value shifts
- Technical discoveries
- Team velocity changes
- External dependencies

**Step 4: Maintain Flow, Not Sprint Cadence**  
Stop forcing work into 2-week boxes. RAD Process optimizes for continuous flow. Ship when ready, not when the sprint ends.

**Step 5: AI-Generated Insights, Not Manual Retros**  
Buildly Labs automatically surfaces:
- What's blocking flow
- Where the team is spending time
- What's creating coordination overhead
- Where AI could accelerate delivery

**Why Buildly Labs:**  
RAD Process is designed to be implemented through Buildly Labs. While you can adopt RAD principles manually, Buildly Labs automates the coordination, dependency tracking, and adaptive planning that makes RAD Process work at scale.

### POST-WEEK 4: ITERATE & SCALE

**What to Do Next:**

1. **Analyze funnel performance**
   - Where do people drop off?
   - Which assets get the most engagement?
   - What questions does the GPT get most often?

2. **Optimize based on data**
   - A/B test headlines, CTAs
   - Add new Starter Kit assets based on demand
   - Expand GPT training based on real conversations

3. **Scale outreach**
   - Increase speaking bookings
   - Launch paid ads (if conversion rates justify)
   - Build affiliate/referral program with Buildly partners

4. **Expand content**
   - Weekly blog posts
   - Video content (YouTube, LinkedIn)
   - Guest posts on high-authority sites

**Long-Term Goal:**  
Radical Therapy and RAD Process become synonymous with AI-powered product development. Every founder, PM, and CTO building with AI knows they need to move beyond Agile—and they know RAD Process + Buildly Labs is how.

✅ **Visitors know exactly what to do next**  
- Primary CTA (Starter Kit) is obvious and compelling
- Clear path from Radical Therapy → RAD Process → Buildly Labs
- Multiple on-ramps (homepage, GPT, speaking) depending on persona

✅ **Radical Therapy, RAD Process, Buildly Labs, GPT, and speaking reinforce each other**  
- Radical Therapy provides the principles
- RAD Process provides the methodology
- Buildly Labs provides the AI-native implementation
- GPT educates and qualifies

- Starter Kit converts

✅ **The book becomes a credential, not the product**

## FINAL NOTES FOR GREG

**This is your funnel. Own it.**

The hardest part of authority marketing is believing you deserve authority. You wrote the book. You built the company. You've led the teams. You have the credibility.

Now turn it into traffic, leads, and revenue.

**Ship Week 1 before optimizing Week 4.**  
Perfect is the enemy of done. Get the homepage live, launch the Starter Kit, and iterate based on what converts.

**Don't undersell yourself.**  
Your speaking fees should reflect your expertise. Your advisory rates should reflect the value you create. Radical Therapy isn't a side project—it's your platform.

**Use the GPT as your co-founder.**  
Let it handle the first layer of education and qualification. You focus on high-leverage conversations.

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**  
The funnel compounds. Every talk leads to more awareness. Every Buildly customer becomes a case study. Every GPT conversation builds your dataset.

Build it. Ship it. Iterate it.

You've got this.
