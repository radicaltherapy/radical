      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Agile was designed for a world where humans wrote every line of code, manually coordinated every handoff, and planned in 2-week sprints. But AI changed everything. This primer explains why your Agile process is now the bottleneck—and what comes next.

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 gradient-text">Section 1: Why Frameworks Fail</h2>
      
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Process Theater vs. Real Work</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Your team spends 5-10 hours per week in sprint planning, standups, and retros. Meanwhile, GitHub Copilot writes code faster than you can plan it. The coordination overhead that Agile was designed to manage is now automated by AI.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>The paradox:</strong> You adopted AI tools to move faster, but you're still planning like it's 2015. Sprint commitments, story point estimation, and manual status updates feel like process theater—performing productivity rather than creating value.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Illusion of Predictability</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Agile promised predictability through sprint commitments. But AI-powered development is inherently unpredictable. When Copilot completes a feature in 2 hours instead of 2 days, your sprint plan is instantly obsolete.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>The reality:</strong> You can't predict velocity when AI writes half your code. Instead of fighting this unpredictability, RAD Process embraces it through continuous adaptive planning.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Compliance Kills Creativity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Agile became a checklist: daily standups ✓, sprint retrospectives ✓, burndown charts ✓. Teams follow the rituals but lose the principles. Compliance replaces judgment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Engineers spend more time updating Jira than shipping code. Product managers become sprint coordinators instead of strategic thinkers. Creativity dies under the weight of process compliance.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 gradient-text">Section 2: The Three Foundations of Radical Therapy</h2>
      
      <div class="mb-10 p-6 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 rounded">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-4">1. Flow Over Frameworks</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>What flow means for product teams:</strong> Uninterrupted time for deep work. Minimal context switching. Continuous shipping instead of sprint-based releases.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>How to measure it:</strong> Not story points. Not velocity. Instead: time to ship, developer satisfaction, and actual outcomes delivered.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Common flow killers:</strong> Daily standups that break focus. Sprint planning marathons. Manual status updates. Jira ticket hygiene. Context switching between "work" and "process."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-10 p-6 bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-600 rounded">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-900 mb-4">2. Human-in-the-Loop</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>AI as amplifier, not replacement:</strong> AI writes code, but humans decide what to build. AI surfaces insights, but humans make strategic calls. AI automates coordination, but humans maintain relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Where humans add the most value:</strong> Defining outcomes. Prioritizing trade-offs. Maintaining vision. Building trust. Making judgment calls that AI can't.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>How to integrate AI without losing judgment:</strong> Let AI handle coordination overhead. Let humans focus on strategy, creativity, and relationships. Use AI to amplify human decision-making, not replace it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-10 p-6 bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 rounded">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-4">3. Radical Transparency</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Why transparency is uncomfortable (and necessary):</strong> When everyone sees the same truth, there's nowhere to hide. Misalignment becomes visible. Progress (or lack of it) is undeniable. Uncomfortable? Yes. Essential? Absolutely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>The difference between visibility and surveillance:</strong> Surveillance tracks activity. Transparency reveals outcomes. Surveillance measures hours. Transparency measures impact.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Building trust through truth:</strong> When AI generates real-time insights about what's working and what's not, teams can't hide behind Jira tickets. They have to confront reality—and that builds trust faster than any retro.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 gradient-text">Section 3: Principles in Practice</h2>
      
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Radical Therapy Changes Planning</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Instead of sprint planning, use AI-assisted adaptive planning. Define outcomes, not features. Let AI map dependencies and risks. Prioritize continuously, not every 2 weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of "5 story points for user auth," try "Users can securely log in using OAuth." AI helps break it down. Humans decide if it's the right priority.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How It Transforms Standups and Retros</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Standups become optional.</strong> AI-generated status updates replace manual check-ins. Only meet when human coordination is needed—not by default.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Retros become real-time.</strong> AI surfaces blockers, velocity changes, and process friction continuously. No need to wait 2 weeks to learn what's broken.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How It Changes Roadmaps</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Roadmaps become living documents, not static plans. AI adapts priorities based on velocity, dependencies, and business needs. Teams ship continuously instead of waiting for sprint boundaries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Result:</strong> Faster shipping, less process overhead, more strategic thinking.
